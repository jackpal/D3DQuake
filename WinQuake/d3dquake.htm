<h1>D3DQuake 0.1 Release Notes</h1>
<p>Jack Palevich, <a href="mailto:jack@palevich.com">jack@palevich.com</a></p>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>D3DQuake is a modification of the id Software GLQuake version of the Quake
1.09 engine. D3DQuake is just GLQuake modified to use Direct3D 7.0 instead of
OpenGL.</p>
<h2>Mini FAQ</h2>
<p><b>Q:</b> What is D3DQuake?</p>
<p><b>A:</b> D3DQuake is GLQuake modified to run on top of Direct3D 7.0 instead
of OpenGL. GLQuake uses a fairly small (50 function) subset of OpenGL. It only
took a few days to write Direct3D versions of these calls.</p>
<p><b>Q:</b> Why did you do this?</p>
<p><b>A:</b> Because I wanted to learn about Quake, and about Direct3D, and I
thought it would be cool.</p>
<p><b>Q:</b> In your day job you work for WebTV, which is a subsidiary of
Microsoft. Don't you have an ulterior motive for doing this?</p>
<p><b>A:</b> Sure! OpenGL is great, but DirectX deserves more respect that it
currently gets.. One reason I wrote D3DQuake is that I wanted to see how well
Direct3D compares to OpenGL in terms of ease-of-use and performance.</p>
<p><b>Q:</b> So will D3DQuake work on any video card that supports Direct3D?</p>
<p><b>A:</b> No. Right now the D3D card has to have DirectX 7 drivers, 8 MB of
RAM and 32-bit textures. D3DQuake has&nbsp; only been tested on Windows 2000
with the NVIDIA TNT2 and the NVIDIA GeForce256.</p>
<h2>Known Bugs / Limitations</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Does not use multitexturing.</li>
  <li>Requires 32 bpp textures.</li>
  <li>Uses 32 bpp textures for light maps.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Code Notes</h2>
<p>All the Direct3D-specific code is in the file gl_fakegl.cpp. In addition, I
had to make a few small changes to the main sources. These patches are #ifdef'd
using the preprocessor symbol D3DQUAKE. Presumably, you could merge this code
base with any of the other modifications to GLQuake, and it would still work.
The only caveat is that if the other modification uses some new feature of
OpenGL, you'd have to add support for that new feature.</p>
<p>If you look at the source code for gl_fakegl.cpp, you'll see that it's all
pretty straightforward. For the most part, each of the OpenGL calls that Quake
uses has a corresponding D3D call. All I had to do was convert the arguments.</p>
<p>To compile, open the WinQuake project in Visual Studio 6.0 or later. Choose
either the &quot;Win32 D3D Release&quot; or the Win32 D3D Debug&quot;
configuration. Build. The resulting executable can be used the same way as
GLQuake.exe.</p>
<h2>Future Work</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Enable multitexturing.</li>
  <li>Fix the TextureTable implementation to look up textures more quickly.
    Right now it's O(n) It should be a hash table or a sparse array.</li>
  <li>Do some performance comparisons with OpenGL, and fix any performance
    bottlenecks.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Acknowledgements</h2>
<p>I'd like to thank id Software, especially John Carmack, for releasing the
sources to Quake. And I'd like to thank the members of the DIRECTXDEV mailing
list for answering my questions.</p>
